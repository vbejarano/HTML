# Web-Visualization-Dashboard
The goal for this project was to develop a visualization dashboard website to display 
the analysis of how weather changes as one gets closer to the equator. 
This website contains a drop down menu with 4 summary plots with information on Max Temperature,
Humidty, Cloudiness and Wind Speed. It also shows a comparison of all 4 phenomena and a table of the data used
